# You are given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers.
#
# For each number A[i] such that 0 â‰¤ i < N, we want to count the number of
# elements of the array that are not the divisors of A[i]. We say that these
# elements are non-divisors.
#
# For example, consider integer N = 5 and array A such that:
# ```
#     A[0] = 3
#     A[1] = 1
#     A[2] = 2
#     A[3] = 3
#     A[4] = 6
# ```
# For the following elements:
# * A[0] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
# * A[1] = 1, the non-divisors are: 3, 2, 3, 6,
# * A[2] = 2, the non-divisors are: 3, 3, 6,
# * A[3] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
# * A[6] = 6, there aren't any non-divisors.
#
# Write a function:
# ```
# def solution(a)
# ```
# that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers,
# returns a sequence of integers representing the amount of non-divisors.
#
# The sequence should be returned as:
# * a structure Results (in C), or
# * a vector of integers (in C++), or
# * a record Results (in Pascal), or
# * an array of integers (in any other programming language).
#
# For example, given:
# ```
#     A[0] = 3
#     A[1] = 1
#     A[2] = 2
#     A[3] = 3
#     A[4] = 6
# ```
# the function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0], as explained above.
#
# Assume that:
# * N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
# * each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2 * N].
#
# Complexity:
# * expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
# * expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not
#   counting the storage required for input arguments).
#
# Elements of input arrays can be modified.
